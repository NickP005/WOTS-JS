# WOTS-JS

Javascript implementation of WOTS+ signature. Inspired 99% by https://github.com/mochimodev/mochimo/tree/master/src/crypto/wots code owned by Adequate Systems. 
The thing should work, I do not give warranty but seems pretty obvious that works and is theoretically secure as WOTS+ algorithm is.
Credits to @stackoverflo on Discord (founder of Mochimo crypto), Matt Zweil, for explaining me the C code and helping me understanding.

I'm on Discord NickP05#6940 for any question or request.
